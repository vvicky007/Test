## Tasks
We want to build a guidebook for us to play the bartender at our next friday evening house party! \
Being completely new (on scale of 0-4, a 0), we'd like the application to show us all the details right from what the drink looks like to its ingredients and its recipe! Agent 007 wouldn't be Agent 007 with his Martini in a beer mug. 

Here are a few ideas you to get you started. This is entirely a blank space application, incorporate your ideas to make it yours!

-  The list of all cocktails displayed on the Home page, with their name, glass, image and category. (You'll find a few predefined styles in `Cocktail.css`, feel free to add and modify these).

- With each Cocktail item on the home page,  a way to display the details of the cocktails including, Name, Category, Info, glass, instructions and ingredients.

- A way to search, so that the results on the page are filtered and displayed when a search term is entered in the bar

- And ofcourse a way to switch from light to dark theme!
